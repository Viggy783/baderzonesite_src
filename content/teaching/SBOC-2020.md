#### Description
Systems Biology of the Cell (580.429 SB3) is a half-semester course required of all BME majors. Progress in biomedicine requires understanding how individual cellular components function together. Cell and tissue engineers can exploit this knowledge for regenerative medicine. Basic researchers need to understand how failures of individual components, for example due to mutation, lead to disease. This course provides the fundamental tools that you will need to develop and apply quantitative models of cellular systems, including protein signal transduction, gene regulation, metabolism, and large-scale network science.

#### Course Objectives
1. Understand the mathematics behind linear systems theory, including spectral transforms and linear operators. Apply linear systems theory to predict cellular behavior close to equilibrium.
2. Understand what constraints cause cells to behave non-linearly, and how non-linearity affects cellular response, including cooperativity.
3. Understand why non-deterministic behavior is important in biology. Develop and apply mathematical models to describe equilibrium fluctuations. Understand how equilibrium fluctuations and correlations predict non-equilibrium response. Understand quantitatively how stochastic phenomena are essential for patterning specific tissues.
4. Understand tempero-spatial dynamics that are driven by diffusion. Understand the mathematics behind the diffusion equation. Develop a physical understanding of the relationship between time and distance in diffusive motion. Understand different methods by which diffusive processes create tissue-scale spatial patterns in development.
5. (Bonus material in the textbook but not part of the half-semester course.) Use networks as a model to unify studies of complex systems of genes, cells, and organisms. Understand concepts of network percolation and giant component and their relevance to disease and information spread. Understand how diffusion creates a distance metric for networks. Understand the relationship between graph diffusion and graph clustering. Understand the meaning of small-world and scale-free when applied to networks. Understand the representation of metabolism as a reaction network. Apply optimization methods to predict how cells optimize their internal state for the environment.

#### Course Topics
1. Cells as linear systems. Linear systems theory. Spectral transforms. Reverse engineering linear systems. Protein signal transduction.
2. Cells as non-linear systems. Thresholds and ultra-sensitivity. Analog-digital converters. Information theory and gene transcription. Coupled dynamics of transcription and translation. Amplifiers, logic gates, feedback control, oscillators.
3. Cells as stochastic systems. Non-deterministic behavior. Noise in transcription and translation. Delta-Notch patterning.
4. Cells as spatial systems. Spatial patterning of tissues. Morphogen diffusion. Diffusion kernels.
5. (Not in the half-semester course.) Networks of genes, cells, and organisms. Disease propagation on a network. Small-world and scale-free networks. Motifs. Clustering. Metabolic networks and metabolic optimization.

#### Course Expectations & Grading
Each homework and quiz is generally worth 10 points. In-class exams are worth about 40-50 points, and the final exam will be worth about 80-100 points. Course grades will be determined by summing the total points and dividing by the total possible points minus 10. This allows each student to drop one assignment without a grading penalty. This also permits students to miss quizzes for travel to BMES and other conferences, medical school and graduate school interviews, and other events.

Homework assignments are generally due by upload to Blackboard by 11:59 PM on the date due, usually Friday. Late homeworks are not accepted.

Quizzes will be announced at least one main lecture in advance and will be given during the main lecture at the end of the period.

Exam dates are on the syllabus. Usually a single make-up exam date will be scheduled for each exam.

If you must be absent for an academic or professional reason, including BMES or other conferences, medical school or graduate school interviews, or other on-site interviews, please speak to me ahead of time. You must speak to me ahead of time if an absence conflicts with a quiz or exam date.

If you are absent for a non-academic reason, primarily health-related, please have the Dean of Students email me on your behalf.

#### Ethics

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful. Ethical violations include cheating on quizzes and exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair competition.

In addition, the specific ethics guidelines for this course are:

* Homework: students are permitted to work in groups and to use external resources in preparing homework assignments for this course. Each student must turn in a separate physical or electronic copy of each homework, however, to assist with study and record keeping.
* Study materials: all study materials are generally permitted. Advance copies of current-year quiz and exam questions are not permitted, however. Students taking exams at different times, particularly for make-up exams, may not share information.
* Quizzes, exams, and the final: only blank paper, pens, and pencils are permitted. Electronic devices, including calculators, phones, and computers, are strictly forbidden. Equation sheets, if necessary, will be provided in the exam itself.

Report any violations you witness to the instructor.

Students requiring extra time for exams will be permitted to take exams at the SDS Testing Center. Exam times will be selected to overlap with the main lecture if possible, either starting early or finishing late.

A note-taker may be assigned to the course if required.
